# JS In The Park

Monthly San Francisco JavaScript meetup hosting in a covered or inside space in a public park. 

No slides, talks are either slideless or some other type of performance or panel discussion. All content is recorded and released as a weekly podcast.

# Organizers

Being that so many organizers end up travelling for other events it's important that we have a good list of organizers that can pitch in.
